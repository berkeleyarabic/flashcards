<h4 id="wordlistsandglossary">Word lists and glossary</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="berkeleyarabic-glossary.pdf">English-Arabic and Arabic-English
glossary</a> for the above card decks (PDF)</li>
<li><a href="all-words.html">List of all words</a> with some notes (HTML)</li>
</ul>

<p>The glossary includes all of the Mastering Arabic 1 words (up to Unit
16). It may be useful for review and also for reference, since the
glossary in the Mastering Arabic book is only English to Arabic and
doesn&#8217;t list chapter numbers.</p>

<p>Etymologies in the word list notes are mostly copied from Wiktionary.
Most of the words don&#8217;t have them; I added them for words that I
thought were confusing. I can add more if there is interest.</p>

<h4 id="decknotes">Deck notes</h4>

<p><strong>Alphabet with positions</strong>: List with pronunciations sourced from
quizlet.com. I added hamza.</p>

<p><strong>BCC workbook words:</strong> There are slight differences between the
vocabulary lists in the printed workbook versus the eyeVocab software.
Cards with a minus (-) after the group number are in the workbook but
not eyeVocab; cards with a plus (+) after the group number are in
eyeVocab but not the workbook.</p>

<p><strong>Mastering Arabic words:</strong> Unlike the words on the
<a href="https://www.memrise.com/course/1322444/mastering-arabic-1/">memrise.com</a>
flashcards provided by the publisher, these have vowel diacritics. The
publishers seem to have been very conservative in their inclusion of
vocabulary on memrise.com, which lacks over half of the words in the
textbook. In case you are planning to use both paper cards and the
website, the words which are in the textbook but not in memrise are
marked with a &#8220;+&#8221; after the unit number on the front. Words that are
not even in the textbook vocabulary sections are marked with a &#8220;++&#8221;;
some of these are introduced only in the chapter text, or the
workbook.</p>

<p><strong>Pronouns:</strong> The pronouns come from Wikipedia and include some extra
endings, and numbers (i.e. dual), which we don&#8217;t study in class.
Please <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_grammar#Pronouns">read about
them</a> first.
Note the Mastering Arabic cards already include pronouns and endings
as they are introduced by the textbook.</p>

<p>A few cards have transliterations provided. These are formatted so that the transliteration is on the left, and the Arabic is on the right. This is supposed to make it easy to cover the transliteration with your thumb in case you don&#8217;t want to see it.</p>

<h4 id="printingflashcards">Printing flashcards</h4>

<p>Ideally these should be duplex-printed on <em>card stock</em> paper, and cut
out using a paper cutter. I print them at my local print shop, Sukam
Copy, at University and 7th, for $0.25/page. This translates to $5 per
100 words. They also have a paper cutter which you can use for free
(but it is dull!). If you own a good duplex printer then you can buy
your own card stock and print the cards at home for cheaper.</p>

<h4 id="howtostudy">How to study</h4>

<p>Generally I learn words Arabic to English first, a few at a time. This
can be done by taking a few cards out of the deck, like with Mr.
Becker&#8217;s &#8220;splits&#8221; in eyeVocab; or you can hold the full deck and
insert each card just below the top until you&#8217;ve learned it. As I go
through the cards in this way, I try to guess how long I&#8217;ll be able to
remember each word, and I insert it at a corresponding depth in the
deck: harder words go close to the top, easier words go further down.
When I feel I have mastered a word I put it at the bottom.</p>

<p>Eventually I can go through the deck in one pass and guess all the
English words correctly. At that point I turn the deck over and learn
the Arabic for each English word, which is harder. First it&#8217;s a matter
of getting the sound approximately right, then the spelling - which of
the vowels are long, which consonants are emphatic, etc. Sometimes I
pull the top card and try to write the Arabic on a piece of paper,
then I turn it over to see if I made any errors. Sometimes I just try
to visualize the spelling, which is faster than writing the word out,
but difficult for long words. I use a system similar to the one
suggested in the Mastering Arabic textbook: if I pick up a card one
day and get it right the first time, I put it in one of several &#8220;easy&#8221;
envelopes, which I eventually throw away.</p>

<p>Sometimes I use silly mnemonics to remember an Arabic word - if &#8220;big&#8221;
is &#8220;kabīr&#8221; كَبير then I could think of a beer or a bear or something
big. But I find that it is generally preferable to look up the word (I
use Wiktionary) and get the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1">definition and
etymology</a>,
then we see that &#8220;kabīr&#8221; shares the same
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83_%D8%A8_%D8%B1#Arabic">root</a> as
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1#Arabic">&#8220;ʾakbar&#8221;
أَكْبَر</a>
meaning &#8220;greater&#8221; or &#8220;greatest&#8221;, a word that I already know from
exposure to Islam. After doing this I use the word in sentences - not
necessarily Arabic sentences, just as long as I&#8217;m using the Arabic for
the word I&#8217;m trying to learn: &#8220;that&#8217;s a كَبير tree&#8221;, etc.</p>

<h4 id="lookingupwords">Looking up words</h4>

<p>Here&#8217;s a form which looks up words on Wiktionary using the full text
search feature, which is often preferable for Arabic:</p>

<form method="get" action="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search" target="_self">
<input type="text" name="search" value="" style="width:100%;">
<input type="submit" name="fulltext" value="Full text search">
</form>

<p>Also try Michelle Fullwood&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://fuzzyarabic.herokuapp.com/">Fuzzy Arabic
Dictionary</a>, you can type in Latin
transliteration, or a mix of Latin and Arabic, and it gives you the
Arabic script and a short definition.</p>

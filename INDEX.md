### Word lists and glossary

* [English-Arabic and Arabic-English
glossary](berkeleyarabic-glossary.pdf) for the above card decks (PDF)
* [List of all words](all-words.html) with some notes (HTML)

The glossary includes all of the Mastering Arabic 1 words. It may be
useful for review and also for reference, since the glossary in the
Mastering Arabic book is only in the English to Arabic direction, and
doesn't list chapter numbers.

Etymologies in the word list notes are mostly copied from each word's
entry in [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org), which are in turn
copied from various dictionaries. Most of the words don't have notes;
I added them for words that I thought were especially interesting or
confusing. The notes are a work in progress and I am happy to make
corrections or additions.

### Deck notes

**Alphabet with positions**: List with pronunciations sourced from
quizlet.com. I added hamza.

**BCC workbook words:** These are from Dr. Gaye's handwriting practice
workbook.

**Mastering Arabic words:** Unlike the words on the
[memrise.com](https://www.memrise.com/course/1322444/mastering-arabic-1/)
flashcards provided by the publisher, these have vowel diacritics. The
publishers seem to have been very conservative in their inclusion of
vocabulary on memrise.com, which lacks over half of the words in the
textbook. In case you are planning to use both paper cards and the
website, the words which are in the textbook but not in Memrise are
marked with a "*" after the unit number on the front. Words that are
not in the textbook vocabulary sections are marked with a "+". Some of
these extra words are introduced only in the chapter text, or the
workbook; others are introduced by me to support the original chapter
vocabulary (e.g. badminton, lit. "feather ball" - I added "feather"
and "ball" so you can learn these words separately).

**Pronouns:** The pronouns come from Wikipedia and include some extra
endings, and numbers (i.e. dual), which we don't study in class.
Please [read about
them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_grammar#Pronouns) first.
Note the Mastering Arabic cards already include pronouns and endings
as they are introduced by the textbook.

**Berkeley Adult School words:** These are some words from Mr. Omer's
Arabic class at the Berkeley Adult School. The "body parts" list is a
work in progress, I tried to include the plurals from Wiktionary but
most entries have multiple plurals corresponding to different usages.
For example "dog with three heads" vs "heads of state" would use
different forms of the plural noun "heads" in Arabic. The problem is
that I don't know which is which, so the cards just list all
possibilities.

A few cards have transliterations provided. These are formatted so
that the transliteration is on the left, and the Arabic is on the
right. This is supposed to make it easy to cover the transliteration
with your thumb in case you don't want to see it.

### How to study

Some general [comments on printing and studying with flashcards](howtostudy.html).

### Looking up words

Here's a form which looks up words on Wiktionary using the full text
search feature, which is often preferable for Arabic:

<form method="get" action="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Search" target="_self">
<input type="text" name="search" value="" style="width:100%;">
<input type="submit" name="fulltext" value="Full text search">
</form>

Also try Michelle Fullwood's excellent [Fuzzy Arabic
Dictionary](http://fuzzyarabic.herokuapp.com/), you can type in Latin
transliteration, or a mix of Latin and Arabic, and it gives you the
Arabic script and a short definition.

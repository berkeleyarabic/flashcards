فَعَلَ : Form I, main meaning of root
فَعَّلَ || (كَسَّرَ, فَرَّحَ, عَلَّمَ): Form II, intensive or extensive || (break -> shatter, be glad -> gladden, know -> teach) :: Act done with great violence (intensive) or during a long time (temporally extensive), or to or by a number of individuals (numerically extensive), or repeatedly (iterative or frequentative) (to break كَسَرَ  -> to break in pieces, shatter كَسَّرَ). Hence giving causative or factitive signification to intransitive verbs (to be glad فَرِحَ  -> to gladden  فَرَّحَ) (but apparently this meaning is only secondary or derived in Form II, as opposed to being original in Form IV). Transitive verbs become doubly causitive (to know عَلِمَ -> to teach عَلَّمَ)
فَاعَاَ || (قَاتَلَ, كَاتَبَ, حَاسُنَهُ) : Form III, reciprocity and/or striving. Transitive. Bringing into state || (kill -> fight with, write -> correspond with, be good or kind -> treat someone kindly) :: Effort or attempt, plus reciprocity (he killed him قَتَلَهُ -> he tried to kill, or fought with him قَاتَلَهُ). Turns indirect objects into direct objects, with reciprocity (he wrote to the king كَتَبَ إلى ٱلْمَلِكِ -> he corresponded with him كَاتَبَ ٱلْمَلِكِ ). With verbs denoting quality or state, indicates making use of that quality towards another or bringing him into that state (to be good or kind حَسُنَ -> he treated him kindly حَاسُنَهُ).
أفْعَلَ || (أَجْرَى,أَرَى,أَحْمَدَ,أَبْقَلَ,أَيْمَنَ) : Form IV, factitive or causitive || (run -> make run / let flow / let happen, see -> show, praise -> find [it] praiseworthy, vegetables -> produce herbage, Yemen -> go to Yemen) :: Factitive [making be] or causative signification (to run جَرَى -> to make run (to let flow; to let happen) أَجْرَى; to see رَأَى -> to show أَرَى). Declarative or estimative (to praise حَمِدَ -> to find [it] praiseworthy أَحْمَدَ). Comprises many intransitive denominatives [deriving from nouns] (vegetables بَقْل -> to produce herbage أَبْقَلَ). Movement towards a place or period of time, getting into a state, obtaining something, becoming something (Yemen اَلْيَمَنُ -> to go to Yemen أَيْمَنَ)

تَفَعَّلَ || (تَكَسَّرَ,تَعَلَّمَ) : Form V, reflexive of Form II || (break -> be broken in pieces, know -> become learned) :: Reflexive, i.e. expresses state into which object of second form verb is brought into (to break كَسَرَ  -> to break in pieces, shatter كَسَّرَ -> to be broken in pieces تَكَسَّرَ). Translated with passive voice. Also (and more commonly) the "effective", denoting an act done to a person, or state produced in him, by himself or by another. (Form I, عَلِمَ  "to know", Form II عَلَّمَ  "to teach", Form V تَعَلَّمَ "to become learned, to learn", as contrasted with passive of Form II, عُلِّمَ, "to be taught")
تَفاعَلَ || (تَرَامَى, تَمَاوَتَ) : Form VI, reflexive of form III, also false pretense || (throw -> throw oneself down, die -> pretend to be dead) :: Form III idea of effort and attempt becomes reflexive (to throw رَمَى -> to throw oneself down تَرَامَى; to die مَاتَ -> to pretend to be dead تَمَاوَتَ "tamāwata")
إنْفَعَاَ || (اِنْكَسَرَ,اِنْقَادَ) : Form VII, passive || (break -> be broken, lead -> let oneself be led / be docile or submissive) :: Originally "middle" or "reflexive" signification. Distinguished from Form VIII in that (a) the reflexive pronoun is never the indirect object but always the direct object itself, and (b) it never assumes reciprocal signification. Similar/equivalent to passive form (break كَسَرَ -> to be broken اِنْكَسَرَ). Sometimes implies that a person allows an act to be done in reference to him (to lead قَادَ -> to let oneself be led, to be docile or submissive اِنْقَادَ).

إفْتَعَلَ || (اِضْطَرَبَ, اِلْتَمَسَ, اِكْتَسَبَ, اِسْتَبَقَا) : Form VIII, reflexive || (beat -> move oneself to and fro / be agitated, touch -> feel about for a thing / seek for it, earn -> earn one's living, precede -> the two tried to outrun one another) :: Reflexive or "middle voice". Object is either direct object (accusative) (to beat ضَرَبَ -> to move oneself to and fro, to be agitated اِضْطَرَبَ) or indirect object (dative) implying for oneself, for one's advantage (to touch لَمَسَ -> to feel about for a thing, to seek for it اِلْتَمَسَ, to earn كَسَبَ  -> to earn one's living اِكْتَسَبَ). Reciprocal signification as with Form VI (to precede سَبَقَ -> the two tried to outrun one another اِسْتَبَقَا (VIII) = تَسَابَقَا (VI)). Occasionally passive.

إفْعَلَّ || (اِصْفَأرَّ) : Form IX, colors, high qualities, or defects || (yellow -> to be yellow) :: Qualities that cling very firmly to persons or things; doubling of third radical shows intensiveness. (yellow صفراْء -> to be yellow اِصْفَأرَّ)

إسْتَفْعَاَ || (اِسْتَسْلَمَ, اِسْتَحَلَّ, اِسْتَغْفَرَ, اِسْتَحْضَرَ, اِسْتَخْلَفَ) : Form X, reflexive of Form IV || (escape from -> give oneself up, be lawful -> he thought that it was lawful (to do), pardon -> ask pardon, be present -> require one's presence, caliph -> appoint one as caliph) :: Converts factitive signification of Form IV into reflexive (Form I to escape from سَلِمَ -> Form IV to give up, deliver over أَسْلَمَ -> Form X to give oneself up اِسْتَسْلَمَ). Often indicates that one thinks a certain thing possesses a quality (to be lawful حَلَّ -> he thought that it was lawful (to do) اِسْتَحَلَّ). Often expresses idea of taking, seeking, asking for, or demanding what is meant by Form I (to pardon غَفَرَ -> to ask pardon اِسْتَغْفَرَ; to be present حَضَرَ -> to require one's presence اِسْتَحْضَرَ). Also used in denominatives (caliph خَلِيفَة -> to appoint one as caliph / successor اِسْتَخْلَفَ ).

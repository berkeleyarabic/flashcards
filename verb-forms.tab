فَعَلَ % Form I, main meaning of root
فَعَّلَ % Form II, intensive or extensive %% Act done with great violence (intensive) or during a long time (temporally extensive), or to or by a number of individuals (numerically extensive), or repeatedly (iterative or frequentative) (to break -> to break in pieces). Hence giving causative or factitive signification to intransitive verbs (to be glad -> to gladden) (but apparently this meaning is only secondary or derived in Form II, as opposed to being original in Form IV). Transitive verbs become doubly causitive (to know -> to teach)
فَاعَاَ % Form III, reciprocity and/or striving. Transitive. Bringing into state %% Effort or attempt, plus reciprocity (he killed him -> he tried to kill, or fought with him). Turns indirect objects into direct objects, with reciprocity (he wrote to the king -> he corresponded with him). With verbs denoting quality or state, indicates making use of that quality towards another or bringing him into that state (to be good or kind -> he treated him kindly).
أفْعَلَ % Form IV, factitive or causitive %% Factitive [making be] or causative signification (to run -> to make run; to see رَأَى -> to show أَرَى). Declarative or estimative (to praise -> to find it praiseworthy). Comprises many intransitive denominatives [deriving from nouns] (vegetables بَقْل -> to produce herbage أَبْقَلَ). Movement towards a place or period of time, getting into a state, obtaining something, becoming something (Yemen اَلْيَمَنُ -> to go to Yemen أَيْمَنَ)

تَفَعَّلَ % Form V, reflexive of Form II %% Reflexive, i.e. expresses state into which object of second form verb is brought into (to break in pieces -> to be broken in pieces). Translated with passive voice. Also (and more commonly) the "effective", denoting an act done to a person, or state produced in him, by himself or by another. (Form I, عَلِمَ  "to know", Form II عَلَّمَ  "to teach", Form V تَعَلَّمَ "to become learned, to learn", as contrasted with passive of Form II, عُلِّمَ, "to be taught")
تَفاعَلَ % Form VI, reflexive of form III, also false pretense %% Form III idea of effort and attempt becomes reflexive (to throw -> to throw oneself down; to die -> to pretend to be dead)
إنْفَعَاَ % Form VII, passive %% Originally "middle" or "reflexive" signification. Distinguished from Form VIII in that (a) the reflexive pronoun is never the indirect object but always the direct object itself, and (b) it never assumes reciprocal signification. Similar/equivalent to passive form (break -> to be broken). Sometimes implies that a person allows an act to be done in reference to him (to lead قَادَ -> to let oneself be led, to be docile or submissive اِنْقَادَ).

إفْتَعَلَ % Form VIII, reflexive %% Reflexive or "middle voice". Object is either direct object (accusative) (to beat ضَرَبَ -> to move oneself to and fro, to be agitated اِضْطَرَبَ) or indirect object (dative) implying for oneself, for one's advantage (to touch لَمَسَ -> to feel about for a thing, to seek for it اِلْتَمَسَ, to earn كَسَبَ  -> to earn one's living اِكْتَسَبَ). Reciprocal signification as with Form VI (to precede سَبَقَ -> the two tried to outrun one another اِسْتَبَقَا (VIII) = تَسَابَقَا (VI)). Occasionally passive.
إفْعَلَّ % Form IX, colors, high qualities, or defects %% Qualities that cling very firmly to persons or things; doubling of third radical shows intensiveness. (yellow صفراْء -> to be yellow اِصْفَأرَّ)

إسْتَفْعَاَ % Form X, reflexive of Form IV %% Converts factitive signification of Form IV into reflexive (Form I to escape from سَلِمَ -> Form IV to give up, deliver over أَسْلَمَ -> Form X to give oneself up اِسْتَسْلَمَ). Often indicates that one thinks a certain thing possesses a quality (to be lawful حَلَّ -> he thought that it was lawful (to do) اِسْتَحَلَّ). Often expresses idea of taking, seeking, asking for, or demanding what is meant by Form I (to pardon غَفَرَ -> to ask pardon اِسْتَغْفَرَ; to be present حَضَرَ -> to require one's presence اِسْتَحْضَرَ). Also used in denominatives (caliph -> to appoint one as caliph).

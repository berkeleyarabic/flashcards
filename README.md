## GitHub page for Arabic flashcards

**Go to [public flashcards page](https://berkeleyarabic.github.io/flashcards/)**

This is the Git repository for my Arabic flashcards project.

Here you can view the source files for the project and submit issues to correct mistakes and so on. It's very much a work in progress.

The word lists may be useful if you are interested in creating your own decks, they are in the *.tab files.

The code is messy and maybe not self-contained. I would be happy to try to remedy this if there is interest.

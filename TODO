- tool to automatically get translations from WK

- tool to insert RTL markers on Emacs region

\- Arabic search command

- work out problems with generalizing to other formats/languages. use
  verb-forms cards as an example. also, Hebrew, alphabet. Korean.
  Figure out what a "deck" is, each .tab file needs a .deck file, but
  what is in it. something like a .Ttex file but shorter

- fix "Class Vocab +" appearing in glossary & card foot (should be super)

- desired features based on Git:

    - export only new/changed cards in a deck, since a given
      version/date

    - field-granular three-way merge: if two decks share the same word
      (having been copied) and one of them changes front, back, or
      notes, then detect this and prompt whether to propagate change
      to the other deck

- word-list: way to highlight changes since particular git revision

- how to fix alignment problems?

- try 6x3 format cards

- syntax for four corners, e.g. ||| to separate vertically, or %%. Use
  ^^ for under-transliteration?

- mark "Beta" decks in INDEX.md

- glossary should automatically separate "," and "/" and ";" so that
  multiple entries appear, e.g. "afternoon/evening" should produce
  entry under "evening"

- warn when missing a card front, or when group field is suspiciously
  long, to detect extra or missing ":" field delimiters

- group fields should be "short" "standard" names, e.g. MA2.1. decks
  should specify a mapping from these to (1) card fronts (2) glossary
  abbrev.s (3) word list headings (4) sortable strings

- change english sides to remind student if there is a m, f version on
  the Arabic side, or if singular / pl, or different verb forms...? or
  preposition needed ("thanks (for)")

- what to do with cards with missing plurals etc. because they were
  introduced early?

- alphabet final kaaf is different from classroom one

- generalize LTR logic (e.g. support Hebrew)
    - be more intelligent
    - use regexes
    - force uniformity within quotes, parentheses (or at least both
      ends should match)

- finalize UCB class vocab

\- add examples to verb form cards

- think about "small" size. think about fixing alignment

- deck as Perl hash structure. file specifying deck. defaults being
  overridden. re-implement existing functionality in this form.
  immediate goal is to make it easy to define a deck outside of this
  project directory

- "free-form" deck for e.g. for pronouns.tab, also Hebrew alphabet

- 2-cards and 4-cards deck type. based on standard deck, use regexes
  to specify which cards form groups

- fix/update study tips

- SE post

\- separate out Perl utils: shell stuff, PV

/- use e.g. % instead of : in tables? to allow ":" in notes
    \- or allow \ escaping, change letter-positions \\ -> \\\\

- arabic regex match facility. absence of diacritic matches any
  diacritic; diacritics match in any order

- don't put <tr> on same line as <tbody> in wordlist

- move make-wordlist

- format_group to foot_fmt.pl

- notes should be in separate file? link to cards with hash

- move unit level field to comments preceding each line (or groups of
  lines rather) in preparation for sharing lines between files

- page numbers on flashcard pdfs

- change ++ to +, + to '', '' to *

- introduce labels for each line. base-64:

    <@gKGR1d> line of text
    <@gKGR1d< new line of text

    script to read and write each file, resulting in

    <@gKGR1d> new line of text
    <@gKGR1d> new line of text

    produces error if a label has more than one "<@<"

- check that scripts don't depend on anything in my home directory

- move "how to study" to separate document

    - talk about deficiencies of computer-only flashcard systems
    - use of glossaries and word-lists
    - importance of using flashcard together with course or reading material

- change indexby words to have hints in Arabic?

    - e.g. dhahab (material) : gold
    - e.g. dhahab (not verb) : gold
    - e.g. taktubu (not she) : you (m) write

- experiment with two-word or four-word cards

- Qur'an vocab

- https://quizlet.com/10941689/the-99-names-of-allah-flash-cards/

- glossary for just BCC Arabic 1A

- change wordlist to use CGI::HTML::Functions, rather than
  multimarkdown

    - checkbox to hide notes?

    - proportional column widths in HTML

- clean up notes, fill them in.

- html version of arabic_fixup - put only arabic in a span

- generalize fixup subs to multiple language scripts?

\- PV.pm, U.pm - remove unnecessary stuff

- do something like publish-latest to manage generated files? https://blog.kentcdodds.com/why-i-don-t-commit-generated-files-to-master-a4d76382564?gi=c8d63c52d50d

    \- for now use git-diff-sources

----------------

\- fix randomness in glossary generation causing false differences

\- glossary generation, html and pdf (done html)

\- change "table" links to point to HTML vocabulary tables with notes

\- regression testing based on pdftotext and "git show"

\- check for non-Arabic commas in Arabic

\- move encode/decode to ReadTable?

\- pdf index of words, alphabetized (glossary!)

i think it is important to keep words of similar difficulty grouped
together, so that they can be studied at the same time, with the same
tools and mindset, and with the same frequency. i think this is the
purpose of the Leitner method. having easy words mixed in with hard
words would hinder the learning of the hard words; and having hard
words mixed in with easy words would make it cumbersome to review the
easy ones.

now, in following the Leitner "box" method you may find that you end
up with a stack of cards which is too large to go through conveniently
in one sitting.

it is important to split it up into two stacks. however, you should at
the same time try to take advantage of this opportunity to split it
into stacks of two different levels of difficulty, so that you can
preserve the basic desiderata of the method. if you shuffle the stack,
then it is much easier to divide it into levels of different
difficulty, since then you can for example go by groups of ten, using
the randomness to assure that each group of ten is representative of
the whole stack.

# The alif with waṣla over it is called the alifu l-waṣli (اَلِفُ ٱلْوَصْلِ) "alif of connection". It indicates that the alif is not pronounced as a glottal stop (written with the letter or diacritic hamza ء), but that the word is connected to the previous word (like liaison in French).

# Outside of vocalised texts, the waṣla is usually not written.

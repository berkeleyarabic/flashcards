<h3 id="howtostudywithflashcards">How to study with flashcards</h3>

<p>Generally I learn words Arabic to English first, a few at a time. This
can be done by taking a few cards out of the deck and learning them
separately (like with Mr. Becker&#8217;s &#8220;splits&#8221; in eyeVocab). Or you can
hold the full deck and insert each card just below the top until
you&#8217;ve learned it. As I go through the cards in this way, I try to
guess how long I&#8217;ll be able to remember each word, and I insert it at
a corresponding depth in the deck: harder words go close to the top,
easier words go further down. When I feel I have mastered a word I put
it at the bottom.</p>

<p>Eventually I can go through the deck in one pass and guess all the
English words correctly. At that point I turn the deck over and learn
the Arabic for each English word, which is harder. First it&#8217;s a matter
of getting the sound approximately right, then the spelling - which of
the vowels are long, which consonants are emphatic, etc. Sometimes I
pull the top card and try to write the Arabic on a piece of paper,
then I turn it over to see if I made any errors. Sometimes I just try
to visualize the spelling, which is faster than writing the word out,
but difficult for long words. I use a system similar to the one
suggested in the Mastering Arabic textbook: if I pick up a card one
day and get it right the first time, I put it in one of several &#8220;easy&#8221;
stacks, which I eventually throw away.</p>

<p>Sometimes I use silly mnemonics to remember an Arabic word - if &#8220;big&#8221;
is &#8220;kabīr&#8221; كَبير then I could think of a beer or a bear or something
big. But I find that it is generally preferable to look up the word (I
use <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a>) and get the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1">definition
and
etymology</a>,
then we see that &#8220;kabīr&#8221; shares the same
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%83_%D8%A8_%D8%B1#Arabic">root</a> as
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1#Arabic">&#8220;ʾakbar&#8221;
أَكْبَر</a>
meaning &#8220;greater&#8221; or &#8220;greatest&#8221;, a word that I already know from
exposure to Islam. After doing this I use the word in sentences - not
necessarily Arabic sentences, just as long as I&#8217;m using the Arabic for
the word I&#8217;m trying to learn: &#8220;that&#8217;s a كَبير tree&#8221;, etc.</p>
